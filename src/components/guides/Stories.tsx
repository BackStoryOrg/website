                Stories are the content each of our worlds produces for you to read and consume. We sometimes interchange the word &apos;content&apos; for stories, but they mean the same thing. Our worlds have vast histories across entire planets with millions of events.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-8">
                Stories are the windows into our worlds. They serve as many things including, explanations of a world&apos;s history, elucidation of characters and their lives, interpretation of cultures and religions and a whole lot more.

                We organise stories into <a href="https://www.backstory.ink/guides/collections" className="text-base leading-7 text-indigo-600">collections</a> to help readers understand how they are tied together. We produce different types of collections to help make it easier to group different types of stories together.

                Our stories aren&apos;t just narratives with a beginning, middle and end, we include all kinds of other content as well. From diary extracts, magic potion recipes, to in-character travel journals and famous battle re-tellings. Our content types bring all kinds of creatives to our fictional worlds from authors to travel bloggers and everyone in between.
