              <p>
                When thinking about worlds we often talk about teams. Each Backstory world has a team of people attached to it that we generally call creatives. A team is made up of loads of fantastic people from authors and editors to world-builders, artists and even managers.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-8">
                One of the neat things about our world teams is that they aren&apos;t exclusive. As a creative you can be on more than one world&apos;s team at a time. What&apos;s even more fun is that you could hold a different role on different world teams. You could be an author on one, while being an editor on another.

              <p>
                When talking about stories we also use the term teams. Each story that gets pitched, developed, written and published has its own team. We sometimes refer to them as sub-teams as well, because they are a team within a team.

        <p className="mt-6 text-xl leading-8">
          When a new collection is created it is given a type. We use 4 different types to help readers understand what they can expect from the content of a collection. Each type has its nuances, but we hope the terminology is clear enough for readers to understand.
        </p>
        <div className="mt-10 max-w-2xl">
          <p>
            When we list a collection on our reading platform we always include its type as well. This helps readers know what kind of content they can expect right away and helps them make more intuitive purchasing choices. Helping you purchase the right content to enrich your reading life is always important to us.

                <strong className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Franchise.</strong> When you purchase and read content from a franchise collection, you know you are going to get a macro storyline that continues through each piece of content. It might be a trilogy of novels, or a series of novellas, but you&apos;ll always have a continuous storyline.

                <strong className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Anthology.</strong> Collections of this type are usually a grouping of content along a specific theme. It may be a collection of short stories that take place at a particular point in time of a world&apos;s history, or in a particular region of it. It might be a collection of short stories that are all batte re-tellings from famous battles in the world&apos;s history. There is always a theme.

                <strong className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Experimental.</strong> Collections that are marked as experimental are usually a hotbed of testing. World teams are creative, and will try different things with their content to see how readers feel about it. You might expect to see short-stories in these kinds of collections that are test-beds for potential future franchises. 
              </span>

Don&apos;t expect a continuous storyline, it will most likely be &apos;miscellaneous&apos;.

            We may, over time, introduce new collection types to help improve the clarity of what a specific collection is about. Feedback from our readers and thoughts from our creatives will always help guide us on this path.
