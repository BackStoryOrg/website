                One of the fantastic aspects of the Backstory platform is that if you&apos;re a writer, you can go back to doing what you love without having to worry about everything else. Your dream was to be a writer, so why not <b>just</b> write?

                We engaged in extensive research of the self-publishing industry and came to a few very real conclusions. It&apos;s easy to assume that readers don&apos;t buy your content because it isn&apos;t any good, but they can&apos;t know that until they buy it and read it. The real problem is most likely your marketing, but that shouldn&apos;t have to be your problem.
